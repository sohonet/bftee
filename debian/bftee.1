.SH NAME
bftee \- non-blocking tee for FIFOs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bftee
.I fifo_path
.RI [ buffer_size ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bftee
is a specialized version of the standard
.B tee
command designed to work efficiently with FIFOs (named pipes). Unlike regular
.BR tee ,
it won't block when the pipe reader is slow or disconnected. It reads from stdin and writes to both stdout and a named pipe, with internal buffering to handle slow readers gracefully.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I fifo_path
Path to the named pipe (FIFO) to write to. The FIFO must be created before running bftee.
.TP
.I buffer_size
Optional. Number of buffers to use for internal buffering (default: 4096). Each buffer is 2KB.
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
Display buffer statistics to stderr, including current usage, maximum usage, and drop count.
.TP
.B SIGTERM
Graceful shutdown with buffer flush to minimize data loss.
.TP
.B SIGINT
First signal initiates graceful shutdown, second signal forces immediate exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Create a FIFO and use bftee:
.B mkfifo /tmp/output.fifo
.br
.B someprog 2>&1 | bftee /tmp/output.fifo
.TP
Use custom buffer size:
.B someprog 2>&1 | bftee /tmp/output.fifo 8192
.TP
Check buffer statistics during runtime:
.B kill -USR1 $(pidof bftee)
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B bftee
returns 0 on success, non-zero on error.
