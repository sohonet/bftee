# Linux Testing Results for bftee

## Test Environment
- **System**: Linux hoarderpi-5 (Raspberry Pi)
- **Architecture**: aarch64 (ARM 64-bit)
- **Kernel**: 6.12.34+rpt-rpi-v8
- **Distribution**: Debian GNU/Linux (Bookworm)
- **PIPE_BUF**: 4096 bytes (confirmed)

## Test Results

### 1. ✅ Basic Functionality
- stdin → stdout + FIFO works correctly
- Data integrity maintained
- No blocking when reader is present

### 2. ✅ Buffer Flush on Exit
- **Linux Confirmation**: The fcntl() blocking mode switch DOES work on Linux
- Successfully flushed all 1000 lines from buffer to pipe
- No data loss on normal exit

### 3. ✅ Binary Data Integrity
- Random binary data passed through without corruption
- MD5 checksums match for input, stdout, and pipe output
- Handles all byte values (0-255) correctly

### 4. ✅ Build Compatibility
- Compiles cleanly with gcc on ARM64 Linux
- No warnings with -Wall -O2
- Binary runs without issues

## Platform Comparison

| Feature | macOS | Linux |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Build | ✅ Clean | ✅ Clean |
| Basic I/O | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Binary Data | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Perfect |
| Buffer Flush | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| PIPE_BUF | 512 bytes | 4096 bytes |

## Conclusion

The bftee implementation works correctly on both macOS and Linux. The comment in the code about fcntl() not working appears to be outdated - our tests confirm it works properly on both platforms. The main platform difference is the PIPE_BUF size (512 on macOS vs 4096 on Linux), which affects atomic write guarantees but doesn't impact bftee's functionality.
