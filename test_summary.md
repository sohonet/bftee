# bftee Edge Case Test Results

## Summary

All major edge cases have been tested successfully:

### 1. ✅ Binary Data Handling
- Binary data passes through bftee without corruption
- MD5 checksums match for both stdout and pipe output
- Handles all byte values (0-255) correctly

### 2. ✅ Buffer Statistics (SIGUSR1)
- Statistics are properly displayed on stderr
- Format: `Buffer use: active (maxUse/bufferSize), STDOUT: count PIPE: writes:drops`
- Successfully tested with buffer fills

### 3. ✅ Custom Buffer Sizes
- Command line parameter for buffer size works correctly
- Tested with very small buffers (5, 10) to force overflow conditions
- Default size of 4096 when not specified

### 4. ✅ Large Data Transfers
- Successfully handled 1MB+ data transfers
- Data integrity maintained for large files
- No data loss when reader keeps up

### 5. ✅ Signal Handling
- SIGUSR1: Displays statistics
- SIGTERM: Graceful shutdown (attempts to flush buffer)
- SIGINT: First signal initiates shutdown, second forces exit
- SIGPIPE: Ignored (prevents crash on reader disconnect)

### 6. ✅ Non-blocking Behavior
- Program doesn't block when no reader is connected
- Continues to write to stdout even if pipe is blocked
- Buffers data internally when pipe is full

### 7. ✅ Reader Disconnect/Reconnect
- Handles reader disconnection gracefully
- Can reconnect and continue reading buffered data
- No crashes or data corruption

## Known Limitations

1. **Buffer Flush on Exit**: ✅ **WORKS CORRECTLY** - Despite the comment saying "this does not seem to work", testing confirms that the blocking mode switch and buffer flush on exit functions properly. All buffered data is successfully written to the pipe before exit.
2. **Partial Write Handling**: TODO comment indicates partial writes aren't fully handled in the flush code at exit (lines 182-186)
3. **Buffer Drops**: When buffer is full, oldest data is dropped (by design) - this is the intended behavior for a non-blocking tee

## Performance Characteristics

- Block size: 2048 bytes
- Default buffer count: 4096 (8MB total buffer)
- Atomic writes up to 4096 bytes on Linux pipes
- Efficient circular buffer implementation

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Binary data test
dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1024 count=10 | ./bftee /tmp/pipe > out.bin

# Statistics test
seq 1 1000 | ./bftee /tmp/pipe &
kill -USR1 $!

# Custom buffer test
seq 1 100 | ./bftee /tmp/pipe 10

# Large data test
dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1 | ./bftee /tmp/pipe > large.out
```
