Description: Non-blocking tee for FIFOs
 bftee is a clone of the standard tee command that handles FIFOs
 (named pipes) in a non-blocking manner. Unlike regular tee, bftee
 will not block when no reader is connected to the FIFO.
 .
 Features:
  - Non-blocking FIFO writes
  - Configurable buffer size
  - Signal handling for statistics and graceful shutdown
  - Automatic reconnection handling for FIFO readers
  - Buffer flush on exit to minimize data loss
